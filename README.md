# Installation

- Build the solution in the APIAddIn folder using visual studio
- Using Regedit add the registry key to list Sparx EA to the class.

- Start EA.
- You should see the extension menus in Extensions-API MDG.
  -   The extensions are context sensitive


# FAQs
 - The extensions by default export into d:\generated folder on your file system.
  - See the FileManager.cs where you can change this.

- Be sure to set your diagrams to a stereotype of APIDiagram, SchemaDiagram or SampleDiagram to enable the appropriate menus.

- Is there a sample EAP project file available
  - Yes I can send you a sample EAP project.  Get in contact with me at phil@xceptionale.com.


- How is the Add In used.
  - This AddIn is used in conjunction with the maven pom file to build and validate the exported raml,json schema and json files.  
    - It builds a library of reusable traits, resource types into a jar. (See the PanAPI directory)
    - It copes the src into target and extracts the PanApi artefacts.
    - Using a number of tools it validates the raml, validates the samples against the schema and then build html documentation, java pojo jars and raml.zip files.
    - I have not included each of the tools used.

- How are changes made
  - Make the changes to the source
  - Build in Visual studio
  - Then restart EA.

  - There are unit tests to be able to validate changes before having to run in Spark EA.


# Thanks
  This project makes use of the [Yaml.NET](https://github.com/aaubry/YamlDotNet). I have had to clone the source code into this project as without changes I couldnt get the raml syntax to be generated correctly.
  
  This project also reliese upon the [SVG Export](http://community.sparxsystems.com/community-resources/706-svg-diagram-export-add-in).
  Please install this plugin.
